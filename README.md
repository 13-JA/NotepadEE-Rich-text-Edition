# Notepad==
Simple version of notepad for computers without simple-enough notepad software


HTML file is for Chromebooks


To build on Mac, run 
```
cd ~/Downloads && curl -LO https://github.com/matthewyang204/NotepadEE/releases/download/1.1/buildMacVersion.sh && sh buildMacVersion.sh
```


Note: If building from source, unzip the node_modules.zip file to the source folder before building. You can download it from the latest release.

Usage note: Currently, the load button doesn't work. For now, just drag the text file into the window, and it will open in another window. CMD+C and CMD+V it into the text box and you should be good to go.
